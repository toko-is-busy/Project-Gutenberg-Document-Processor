*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WHISTLER ***

THE ob8ject of this book is to portray the chara9cter of the MANLY BOY—a
character that never fails to inspire love and esteem, if only it be
natural and genuine. That a youth may still be a real boy in his tastes,
his pursuits, and his feelings,—as every young l*ad certainly ought to
be,—and yet exhibit something of true manliness in his spirit and
deportment, will, it is hoped, be made manifest to the youngest mind, in
the story of WHISTLER.
